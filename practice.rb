# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

# a = 8
# if a == 10
#   p 0 
# else 
#   p -1
# end 


# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

# a = 2

# if a < 10
#   p -1 
# elsif a > 10
#   p 1
# elsif a == 10 
#   p 0 
# end 

# 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.

# a = 11
# b = 9

# if a < 10 && b < 10 
#   p 1
# else p 0
# end 

# 4. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise.


# a = 10000
# if a > 9000
#   p 1
# else p -1
# end
